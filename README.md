# Vibration-Reduction-in-Driver-Seat-using-Negative-Stiffness-Mechanism
To improve the driver’s ride quality of off-road vehicles, the seat suspension was added by the negative stiffness
structure to reduce the vibration of the driver’s seat.

Developed MATLAB code and a Simulink model to compare vibration reduction in conventional seat suspension with a negative stiffness mechanism.
